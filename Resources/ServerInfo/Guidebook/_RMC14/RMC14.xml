  #AU-14 Guidebook

  Welcome to AU-14.

  This is an HRP server set in the Aliens Universe inspired by CM-SS13 and CM-SS13 PvE!

  The guidebook, roadmap and rules for the game can be found on the lobby screen, and at any point in the escape menu.

  Click any of the tabs on the left to learn about AU-14 and it's unique content.

  Be sure to read the rules if you haven't already.

  New to AU-14, SS14, or have no CM13 experience? Be careful! A lot of mechanics and values are not the same as standard SS14.
