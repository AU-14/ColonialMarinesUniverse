  ## Avoid using out of character info.
  Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage ("Metagaming").
  - Using information you gain from outside your own character's view and hearing to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious. If you take a ghost role or respawn, unless otherwise stated, you do not remember anything from your past life.
  - If you die and respawn, you may not return as a character you previously played in the same round. For example, if you played "John Doe," you should not respawn as "John Doe." However, you may use the same character appearance and respawn under a different name, as long as you roleplay as a separate individual.
  - Characters are not unconscious during being infected alone, just blinded and muted, shown by the game mechanics.
