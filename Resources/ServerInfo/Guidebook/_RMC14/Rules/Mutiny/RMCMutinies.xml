  ## Mutinies and riots require admin permission.

  [bold]General[/bold]

  - All players, including hostile forces, must obtain admin or game master permission before engaging in riots, mutinies or similar activity.
  - Strikes, revolutions, riots, cults, prison riots (excluding hostile forces), and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden without permission.
  - Staff reserve the right to grant or deny these, and to decide if the reason given is sufficient.

  [bold]Mutinies[/bold]

  - MPs/Law Enforcement are not able to mutiny and will always side with the acting commander, unless they are neutral, in which case they may not help or arrest either side until the mutiny is concluded.\nThis applies to the individial player and not the MP as a whole.
  - Only the Acting Commander, Cell Leader or Colony Administrator can be mutinied against. They must be given a chance to stand down peacefully.
  - During the mutiny, attacking any uninvolved, medical, or surrendered personnel is forbidden.
  - If you have surrendered during a mutiny, you must remain as such.
  - You may not change sides unless you are surrendering.
  - When failed, all sides must be given medical treatment.
  - When succeeded, all sides must be given medical treatment. The next in the command chain should be put in charge.
