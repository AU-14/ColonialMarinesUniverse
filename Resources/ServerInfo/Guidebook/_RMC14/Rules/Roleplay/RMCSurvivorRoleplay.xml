  #Survivor/Colonist Roleplay Standards
  - Survivors and Colonists have more leeway than marines with mental stability. They may be suffering PTSD, paranoia or similar conditions for roleplaying purposes.\nDespite this, survivors and Colonist should not become hostile or cause drastic issues, such as stealing secure equipment.
  - Standard survivors and any command or security colonist roles should not be immediately hostile to the Military nor side with the CLF.
  - If there is an exception due to faction it will be clear.
  - Hostile Faction Survivors cannot attempt to harm other survivors.
  - [bold]Do not hunt, move, or secure monkeys to deny Xenomorph captures. These monkeys lessen the amount of xenos at the start of the round, and make your life easier.[/bold]
  - Survivors should not engage or seek any Xenomorphs before the roundstart xenos have had a chance to evolve (5 minutes). If a Xenomorph enters your vision, but you were not seeking them, you are free to attack them as they have forfeited their early round protection.
