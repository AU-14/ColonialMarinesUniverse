  # Military roleplay standards
  - A person with a "military role" is defined as any character currently apart of a uniformed force (Army, Navy, Marines, etc.) of an established nation (e.g., UA, TWE, UPP). This definition also extends to military contractors and PMCs. CLF and other insurgents are not considered to be a military or colony role.
  - Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known hostile forces as a member of the opposite faction.
  - All personnel in military roles must be mentally stable and fit for duty. Some leeway may be provided when it comes to being mentally unstable. Characters may have PTSD and common mental issues, however it must not greatly effect your ability to function within the military.
  - Important military roles such as specialists, smart gun operators and corpsmen should be following their role objectives.
  - All combat roles should deploy when possible.
  - Correspondents, including military correspondents, should primarily focus on reporting combat and engage in combat only in self-defense or to protect nearby fellow faction members.
  - Medical roles (excluding corpsmen) are not combat roles and should not be used as such.

  ## Ship modifications
  - Deconstruction of military property for materials should not be occuring without orders from the Chief Engineer or Acting Commander. The military would not immediately resort to taking their equipment to pieces for a random unconfirmed distress call.
  - Includes salvaging of things like chairs in briefing, however does not include the barrels and crates in maintenance.
  - Includes the removal of supplies from the ship where not explicitly necessary. You would not drag half the contents of the medical bay to the field immediately.
  - Modifications to the ship should not be made with meta-purposes, do not build a maze or bunker on the ship intended to secure the ship for hijack before you even know hijack is a thing.
