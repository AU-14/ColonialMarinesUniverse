  # Military roleplay standards
  - A person with a "military role" is defined as any character currently apart of a uniformed force (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, etc.) of an established nation (e.g., UA, TWE, UPP). This definition also extends to military contractors and PMCs. CLF and other insurgents are not considered to be a military role.
  - Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known hostile forces as a member of the opposite faction.
  - All personnel in military roles must be mentally stable and fit for duty. Some leeway may be provided when it comes to being mentally unstable. Characters may have PTSD and common mental issues, however it must not greatly effect your ability to function within the military. Military characters may never choose to commit suicide as a result of mental health issues.
  - Important military roles such as leaders, machine gun operators and corpsmen should be following their role objectives.
  - All combat roles should deploy when possible.
  - Military correspondents, should primarily focus on reporting combat and engage in combat only in self-defense or to protect nearby fellow faction members.
  - Medical roles (excluding corpsmen/combat medics) are not combat roles and should not be used as such.
