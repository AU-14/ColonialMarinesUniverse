  # NON-Modifiable Third-Party Regulations

  GOVFOR is encouraged to recover any third-party personnel found in the [bold]Area of Operations[/bold] that are unable to fend for themselves.

  ## General

  - All recovered personnel must be searched on arrival by GOVFOR personnel, with all weapons and unauthorized items secured within the armory.
  - They should be given a medical examination if personnel are available.
  - Recovered personnel have the right to remain silent and must not be punished for invoking it.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] are not required to detain civilian prisoners that are recovered.

  ## Military and Paramilitary

  - Third-party military or paramilitary personnel may be allowed to continue their operations if they prove beneficial or indifferent to GOVFOR interests. (This is also located in the [bold]Rules of Engagement[/bold])
  - They may be given permission to keep their weapons and equipment on the warship or in the base, provided they are beneficial to the operation.
  - They may also be denied access to the warship or base.

  ## Returning to the AO

  - Recovered Personnel may deploy back to the [bold]Area of Operations[/bold] and request their equipment be returned. GOVFOR personnel must, however, escort them back to the dropship to ensure they deploy.
  - Returning from this deployment requires another search, but medical examinations may be skipped.

  ## Eviction

  Recovered personnel may be evicted and denied access to the ship or base by the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Acting Commander[/bold][/color].
  - Recovered personnel may be evicted if they commit any major crime.
