  # NON-Modifiable Deployment Restrictions

  ## Commander Field Deployment

  - The [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] has the right to deploy to the frontline for the sake of commanding their personnel from a direct point of view. Deployments must be for the sake of the personnel and operation, and not for the personal glory of the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color].
  - A [color=#90EE90][bold]Duty Officer[/bold][/color] may not deploy.
  - This right to deploy is exclusive to the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Platoon Commander[/bold][/color].

  [bold]Preparing to Deploy[/bold]

  - The [color=#00CBFE][bold]Platoon Commander[/bold][/color] and [bold]Operations Officer[/bold] should not be deployed at the same time, if both are present.
  - Deployment should not be done unless they are confident overwatch can be managed in their absence.
  - If the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Platoon Commander[/bold][/color] is present, the [bold]Operations Officer[/bold] requires permission to deploy.

  [bold]When Deployed[/bold]

  - The deploying [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] must still command and communicate frequently with the platoon.
  - Combat should be reserved when assisting GOVFOR personnel in a supporting capacity, in defense of others and self, or directly leading an offensive maneuver.
  - They should avoid unnecessarily putting themselves in danger, and remain close to marines to focus on providing clear orders.
