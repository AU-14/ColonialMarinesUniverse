  # Lethal Force
  - Lethal force should always remain a last resort.
  - During emergencies like mutinies, boardings, or when suspects have used lethal or disabling weapons against personnel, lethal force is authorized. The suspect should only be fired upon until they can no longer present any harm.
  - A suspect that has been detained and restrained must be kept safe from harm, as they are in [color=#ff000d][bold]GOVFOR[/bold][/color] custody.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may use lethal force against targets that are not affected by non-lethals attempts, such as synthetics.
