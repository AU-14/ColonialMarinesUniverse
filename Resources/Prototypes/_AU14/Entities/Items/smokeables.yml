Expensive, smooth, and a favorite among officers and smugglers alike.

  description: First handed out in bulk to terraforming crews as a no-frills necessity, these cigarettes lit easily, burned evenly, and offered a straightforward, dependable smoke. The flat, dusty flavor and steady draw quickly made them a colonial staple. Koorlander later scaled production on frontier farming worlds and locked in exclusive trade deals with the Colonial Administration.

  description: A bold experiment in marketing by the Koolander Corporation, these brutal, unfiltered menthol cigarettes come in dusty rose packaging aimed at the women of the Colonies. The scent is so overpowering that they are sometimes used to keep bugs out of field tents. Despite the effort, they are rarely chosen and mostly sit untouched in vending machines, quietly daring someone to try. Whether anyone actually likes them is another question.
